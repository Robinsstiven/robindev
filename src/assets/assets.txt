This is just a text file so I can explain the objective of the current folder.

This folder was made to store the assets such as logo and images that the project migth require.

The color pallete may be
Joyful:  #428C6A, #A0D9BE, #F2A444, #F2B56B, #8C472E
Blue & green: #0998E6, #0911E6, #09DEE6, #581CE6
Blue monochromatic: #2B5AB3, #385180, #0956E6, #313B4C, #313B4C
Matching pallete (Color Space): #0A1CF1, #0066FF, #008AFF, #00A3FF, #00B8DB, #00CB98 (I like this one because of the contrast between blue and green, however, I would like to make a Spacial design)
Spacial: #040626, #061071, #3269DB, #912F93, #77309A
